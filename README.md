Build a simple Todo application

The application should allow users (no authentication needed) to
- Create a new task
- Delete a task
- Edit a task
- List all tasks
- Mark/Unmark a task as done/not done

A task consists of 4 attributes: id, note, date_created, is_done

Front-end
- Must be a single page application
- Uses Backbone and Bootstrap
- Comminucates with the backend through some sorts of API

Backend
- Uses ExpressJS to build a simple API service
- Stores data in memory using any kind of data structure that you see fit
- Needs to have at least 1 unit test

You are free to set up the project structure as you like, and use any other extra libraries.

This exercise is simple, and should not take more than 6 hours to complete. Fork this repository and create a pull request when you finish
